**Simple Calculator**

This is a stylish and functional basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features:**

- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Includes a clear (`AC`) button to erase the entire expression.
- Provides a backspace (`DEL`) button to delete individual characters.
- Offers a percentage calculation (`%`).
- Supports square root (`âˆš`) calculation.
- Displays user input and calculation results in a clear and user-friendly interface.

**How to Use:**

1. **Open the HTML file** (e.g., `index.html`) in your web browser.
2. **Click the buttons** to enter numbers, operators, and functions:
    - Use the number buttons (0-9) to enter operands.
    - Click the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
    - Press `AC` to clear the entire expression.
    - Use `DEL` to backspace and delete individual characters.
    - Click `%` to calculate the percentage of a value.
   
3. **Click the `=` button** to evaluate the expression and display the result.

**Additional Notes:**

- The calculator uses the built-in `eval` function to evaluate expressions. While convenient, it's important to be aware of potential security risks associated with user-provided input. Consider implementing more robust input validation and sanitization techniques for production use.
- For a more robust experience, you might explore the use of a dedicated math expression parser library.
